# Stochastic characterization and reconstruction of material microstructures by VQVAE and PixelCNN
This notebook contains the code for constructing a Vector Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (VQVAE) and Pixel Convolutional Neural Network (PixelCNN) for characterization and reconstruction of material microstructures. 

## Example: lo-carbon-steel microstructure
We tested the framework in the generation of low-carbon-steel microstructures from the given material processing. If you need the microstructure images used for example, please cantact the authour.
